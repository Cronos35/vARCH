# vARCH
Virtual Audio Reactive Concert Hall is an audio reactive virtual stage built in Unity made to enhance vTuber music streams. It listens to any app open in the background playing audio and uses the audio data to control lights in the virtual stage.

# How to use
To use this, simply open <b>Virtual Audio Reactive Concert Hall.exe</b> and add it as a background in your streaming software.

# Customization Features
Upon opening vARCH, you will see a gear button on the bottom left hand side of the screen. Click on it to open the stage options screen, where you can change light colors and graphics settings

# Support the project
vARCH is a one man project and more features are planned for the future if enough people use it. If you'd like to donate to the project, you can donate here:
